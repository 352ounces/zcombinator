## Why this exists

Existing token launchpads are not built for builders. They have fixed supply and reward devs based on trading volume. Devs either bundle supply and dump on people, or run out of money and abandon their projects. This applies to people building technology AND communities.

We fixed this. Tokens on Z Combinator start with 1B supply and have **zero trading fees**. Instead, the protocol mints 1M new tokens every 24 hours that only the original creator can claim. This gives devs consistent funding to keep building and reward contributors.

## How it works

1. **Launch**: Create your token with whatever metadata you want
2. **Sign**: Sign the transaction with your wallet (we never see your keys)
3. **We submit**: We add our signature and put it on Solana
4. **Daily claims**: Come back every 24 hours to claim your 1M tokens
