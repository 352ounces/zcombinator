title: "Confirm Withdrawal Transaction"
description: "POST /damm/withdraw/confirm - Submit signed withdrawal transaction to the blockchain"
---

## Overview

Confirms and submits a signed liquidity withdrawal transaction to the Solana blockchain. This endpoint validates the transaction structure comprehensively and broadcasts it to the network. The transaction removes liquidity from a Meteora DAMM v2 pool and transfers all withdrawn tokens to the manager wallet.

<Warning>
**Concurrent request handling**: Only one withdrawal operation can be processed at a time for each pool. Additional requests will wait in queue until the current operation completes.
</Warning>

## Process Flow

This endpoint performs extensive validation before submitting the transaction:

<Steps>
<Step title="Validate Parameters">
Ensures signedTransaction and requestId are provided
</Step>

<Step title="Retrieve Request Data">
Looks up the withdrawal request data using the requestId
</Step>

<Step title="Queue Request">
Ensures only one operation processes at a time for this pool (additional requests wait in queue)
</Step>

<Step title="Check Request Expiry">
Verifies the request is not older than 10 minutes
</Step>

<Step title="Deserialize Transaction">
Decodes the Base58 encoded transaction
</Step>

<Step title="Validate Blockhash">
Checks that the transaction's blockhash is recent and valid (within last 150 slots)
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Manager Wallet">
Ensures the fee payer is the manager wallet and has signed the transaction
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Manager Signature">
Cryptographically validates the manager wallet's signature using nacl
</Step>

<Step title="Validate Transaction Structure">
Comprehensive security validation (see Security Validations section below)
</Step>

<Step title="Complete Transaction">
Adds the required signatures to finalize the transaction
</Step>

<Step title="Submit Transaction">
Broadcasts the fully-signed transaction to Solana with preflight checks
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for Confirmation">

</Step>

<Step title="Cleanup">
Removes the request data from memory and releases the pool lock
</Step>
</Steps>

## Security Validations

This endpoint implements comprehensive transaction validation to prevent attacks:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Request Queueing">
    Only one liquidity operation can be processed per pool at a time. Concurrent requests are automatically queued and processed sequentially.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Blockhash Validation">
    Prevents replay attacks by verifying the blockhash is recent (within last 150 slots / ~60 seconds).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Manager Wallet Verification">
    Only the configured manager wallet can submit withdrawal transactions. Both fee payer and signature are verified.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Allowed Programs">
    Only permits instructions from:
    - Token Program (TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA)
    - Associated Token Program (ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL)
    - Compute Budget Program
    - Lighthouse Program (for optimization)
    - Meteora CP-AMM Program (CPMMoo8L3F4NbTegBCKVNunggL7H1ZpdTHKxQB5qKP1C)
    - Meteora DAMM v2 Program (cpamdpZCGKy5JxQXB4dcpGPiikHawvSWAd6mEn1sGG)
    - System Program (for native SOL transfers)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Token Instruction Validation">
    - Only Transfer (opcode 3), InitializeAccount (opcode 9), and TransferChecked (opcode 12) are allowed
    - All transfers must be signed by the LP owner
    - Transfer amounts cannot exceed calculated withdrawal amounts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="6. Destination Validation">
    Transfers can ONLY go to:
    - Manager wallet token accounts (withdrawal recipients)
    - LP owner token accounts (intermediate recipients before transfer)
    Any other destination is rejected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="7. System Transfer Validation">
    For native SOL transfers (when Token B is wSOL):
    - Only SystemProgram.transfer (instruction type 2) allowed
    - Must be from LP owner to manager wallet
    - Amount cannot exceed Token B withdrawal amount
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="8. ATA Instruction Validation">
    Only CreateAssociatedTokenAccountIdempotent (opcode 1) is allowed for ATA program.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="9. Amount Validation">
    All transfer amounts are compared against stored expected withdrawal amounts to prevent over-withdrawal.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
**Manager authorization required**: Unlike fee claims, withdrawals require manager wallet authorization. Only the configured manager wallet can execute withdrawals, preventing unauthorized access to pool liquidity.
</Warning>

## Rate Limiting

This endpoint is subject to rate limiting:
- **10 requests** per 5-minute window per IP
- Returns HTTP 429 when limit exceeded

## Transaction Confirmation

The API attempts to wait for transaction confirmation but continues even if confirmation times out:
- **Confirmation Commitment**: confirmed
- **Timeout Handling**: Logs warning but returns success
- **User Responsibility**: Check transaction status on Solana explorer

You can view the transaction on Solscan: `https://solscan.io/tx/{signature}`

## Concurrent Request Handling

<Warning>
**Request queueing**:

When a liquidity operation is being processed for a pool, subsequent requests for the same pool will wait in queue. This prevents:
- Concurrent withdrawal conflicts
- Transaction race conditions
- Double-processing

Requests are automatically processed in order when the current operation completes.
</Warning>

## One-Time Use

After successful submission:
- The requestId cannot be reused
- You must create a new request for additional operations

## Best Practices

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Blockhash Age">
Submit the signed transaction quickly after receiving it from `/damm/withdraw/build`. Blockhashes expire after ~60 seconds.
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Expiry">
If more than 10 minutes pass, create a new withdrawal request instead of retrying with the old requestId.
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor Transaction">
Use the returned signature to check transaction status on Solana explorers or via RPC.
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Queueing">
If you receive a timeout or slow response, another request may be processing. Wait and retry.
</Step>

<Step title="Manage Withdrawals Carefully">
Withdrawals remove liquidity from the pool. Ensure you're withdrawing the correct percentage.
</Step>
</Steps>
