## Rate limits

We don't want people spamming the API, so there are some basic limits:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Current limits" icon="gauge">
    - **8 requests per IP** every 2 minutes
    - No API keys needed
    - When you hit the limit, you get a 429 error

    ```json
    {
      "error": "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later."
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Need more?" icon="arrow-up">
    Building something cool? DM [@zcombinatorio](https://x.com/zcombinatorio) and tell us:
    - What you're building
    - How many requests you need
    - Why you need them
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How daily claims work

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The schedule" icon="clock">
    - **Every 24 hours** you can claim 1M tokens
    - Starts counting from when you launched your token
    - If you don't claim for a few days, they stack up
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't cheat it" icon="shield-check">
    - We check the blockchain every time
    - Only you can claim your tokens
    - Can't claim the same period twice
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How transactions work

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="You sign, we submit" icon="key">
    - You sign with your wallet (keeps your keys safe)
    - We add our signature and send it to Solana
    - You pay the transaction fees
    - We never see your private keys
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Timeouts" icon="timer">
    - Launch transactions: We keep your keypair in memory until you sign
    - Claim transactions: You have 10 minutes to sign
    - If something fails, just start over
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What we store

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permanent" icon="database">
    - When you launched your token and the details
    - Transaction signatures (for proof)
    - We calculate your claim eligibility from the blockchain each time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporary" icon="clock">
    - Your token keypair until you sign the launch transaction
    - Claim transactions for 10 minutes
    - Rate limit counters for 2 minutes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Health check

Want to see if the API is working?

```bash
curl https://api.zcombinator.io/health
```

This tells you if everything is connected properly.

## Security

- You keep your private keys, we never see them
- You sign all transactions with your wallet
- We maintain the mint authority so you can claim tokens
- Everything is validated against the blockchain in real-time

## Building with this API

1. Handle errors properly (networks fail sometimes)
2. Show loading states so users know what's happening
3. Check claim eligibility before trying to claim
4. Use the health endpoint to make sure we're online
5. Cache token metadata and other data that doesn't change
