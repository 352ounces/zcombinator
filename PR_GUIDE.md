# How to Contribute Code & Earn ZC Tokens

**First time contributing to open source?** This guide walks you through submitting code to Z Combinator.

## What is a Pull Request?

A Pull Request (PR) is how you submit code changes to the Z Combinator project. You propose changes, the team reviews your code, and if it's good, your PR gets merged and you earn ZC tokens.

## For Developers

This guide focuses on **code contributions** - features, bug fixes, and improvements. If you're a developer, this is the primary way to earn ZC tokens.

**Not a developer?** You can still contribute:
- **Work Requests**: Propose features for the team to build
- **Tweet Submissions**: Submit content for the official Twitter account

## Step-by-Step: Submit Your First PR

### Step 1: Get a GitHub Account (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up" in the top-right
3. Create a username and password
4. Verify your email

**That's it!** You now have a GitHub account.

### Step 2: Go to the Z Combinator Page

1. Go to the Z Combinator repository (if you're reading this, you're probably already there)
2. Look for the green button that says **"Code"** - ignore it
3. Look for the tab that says **"Pull requests"** - click that

### Step 3: Start a New PR

1. Click the green **"New pull request"** button
2. You'll see a message saying you need to fork - click **"fork and pull request"** or **"create fork"**
   - A "fork" is just your own copy to work with. GitHub does this automatically!

### Step 4: Choose the Code Contribution Template

You'll see a list of templates. Choose **"Code Contribution"** for submitting your code changes.

(Other templates like "Work Request" and "Tweet Submission" are available for non-developers)

### Step 5: Fill Out the Template

The template is just a form with questions. Answer each one:

- Write your idea clearly
- Explain why it will help Z Combinator grow
- Provide examples if you have them

### Step 6: Submit!

1. Scroll to the bottom
2. Click the green **"Create pull request"** button

**Congratulations!** You just submitted your first PR!

## What Happens Next?

1. The ZC team reviews your code
2. They evaluate the quality, impact, and value of your contribution
3. **Currently**: The team decides if your PR merges and determines your reward
4. **In the future**: Decision markets will determine rewards and merges
5. If merged, you earn ZC tokens (rewards vest over time)

## Tips for Strong PRs

### Write Quality Code
- Follow the project's coding style
- Include tests for your changes
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Avoid unnecessary refactoring

### Explain the Value
Don't just describe what you changed. Explain:
- What problem does this solve?
- Who benefits from this change?
- Why does this matter for Z Combinator?
- How does this impact the project's success?

### Provide Context
- Link to related issues or discussions
- Show benchmarks or performance improvements
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Add examples or documentation

### Communicate Well
- Respond to review feedback promptly
- Share your PR in Discord
- Explain your technical decisions
- Be open to suggestions and changes
