# Non-Technical Contribution Requests

Not a developer? You can still contribute to Z Combinator and earn $ZC tokens through non-technical work.

---

## How to Submit a Request

Submit your work request as a `.md` or `.txt` file in the [/pr-requests](/pr-requests) directory.

**Your request file should include:**

### Title
A clear, descriptive title for your work request

### Discord Username
Your Discord username so we can reach you

### What Should Be Built?
Detailed description of the work you want to complete

### Why Does This Matter?
Impact on the project, who benefits, expected outcome

### Supporting Evidence
Links, examples, data, or anything that supports why this work is valuable

---

That's it. Your request will be reviewed and if approved, you'll be able to get paid in $ZC tokens through the same market-based governance system as code contributions.
