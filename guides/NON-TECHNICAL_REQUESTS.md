# Non-Technical Contribution Requests

Not a developer? You can still contribute to Z Combinator and earn $ZC tokens through non-technical work.

## How to Submit a Request

Submit your work request as a `.md` or `.txt` file in the [/pr-requests](/pr-requests) directory.

**File format:**
- Name your file descriptively (e.g., `twitter-content-strategy.md`, `landing-page-design.txt`)
- Include what you want to work on and why it adds value
- Be sure to include your name in the proposal
- Submit it to: [/pr-requests](/pr-requests)

That's it. Your request will be reviewed and if approved, you'll be able to get paid in $ZC tokens through the same market-based governance system as code contributions.
