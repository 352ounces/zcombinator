# Non-Technical Contribution Requests

Not a developer? You can still contribute to Z Combinator and earn $ZC tokens through non-technical work.

---

## How It Works

Submit requests for non-technical work using the forms below. If your request is approved and completed, it follows the same market-based governance system as code contributions:

1. Submit your request through the appropriate form
2. If approved, a decision market opens on the work
3. Community trades on whether the work adds value to $ZC
4. If the market resolves positively, you get paid in $ZC tokens
5. Rewards vest over time

See [PR-TO-PAID_GUIDE.md](PR-TO-PAID_GUIDE.md) for details on the payment structure and market mechanics. Non-PR work will be paid in a differen structure than PR work.
