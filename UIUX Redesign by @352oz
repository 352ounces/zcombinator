Summary

This PR describes the creation of a new design concept and site structure for the ZCombinator Dapp.
The goal is to build a clean, modern interface with clear navigation and consistent visuals — improving usability for token creators, proposal authors, and traders.
Once the full design concept and prototype are completed, it will be proposed for a adoption through a Quantum Market vote.

This is not a request for team execution — the redesign is being built by me and will be progressively updated in this PR as the work advances.

Purpose

To improve the overall usability, consistency, and visual identity of zCombinator.
The redesigned Dapp aims to reduce friction in complex user flows (token launch, proposal submission, markets trading), strengthen onboarding for new contributors, and present ZCombinator as a leading example of transparent, technically strong launchpad UX.

 Possible Impact

The redesign is expected to bring measurable improvements once implemented:
Better onboarding and comprehension — new users will navigate and understand proposals faster.
Higher creation and participation rates — easier token and proposal creation should increase on-chain activity.
Reduced user drop-offs — smoother flows may lower friction in proposal and trading actions several times.
Improved brand perception — a cohesive, high-quality design will enhance trust and credibility.
Community scalability — reusable design system will help future contributors extend the Dapp faster.
