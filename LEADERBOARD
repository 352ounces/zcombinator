# Code Contribution

## What Code Did You Write?

Created a leaderboard page for traders of % decision markets, sorted by volume. Code will be merged into the percent UI codebase (no code attached here).

## Why Does This Matter?

**Impact / User demand / Performance gains:**
Primary Goal: Increase traders on decision markets to get more feedback and make the markets more accurate.

Currently, I have an arbitrage bot that profits by keeping the spot market price between the pass & fail conditional markets. I propose to use the profts from these decision markets and distribute them amongst the top 10 traders (determined by volume) of the decision markets. 
The profits will be displayed on the leaderboard page, and be updated at the end of each proposal.

At the end of each week, I'll purchase $ZC emissions OTC at a 20% markup. The SOL from the arbitrage will be placed back into the LP and the $ZC will be distributed amongst the best traders equally.

This should provide incentives to stay within the "top 10" traders. The metric for the "top" traders will most likely be replaced with something more specific, but for now, I believe it is sufficient.
